# Coq Library for First-Order Logic

A library for First-Order Logic in Coq

## Installation

We are currently planning to release this as an OPAM package.

Until then, the library can be installed manually.

First, we recommend that you create a new OPAM switch, although this is optional:

```
opam switch create coq-library-fol-8-16 --packages=ocaml-variants.4.14.0+options,ocaml-option-flambda
opam switch link coq-library-fol-8-16 .
eval $(opam env)
```

then, install the library using:

```
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam update
opam install .
```

### Contribuing

In order to compile the library for development, use the above manual installation instructions (preferably creating a new switch), but replace the last command with
```
opam install . --deps-only
```

Compile the library using `make` or using `opam build`.

To contribute, fork the project on GitHub, add a new subdirectory for your project and your files, then file a pull request.
